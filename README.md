# bethe-faster

A fast C++ library implementing the Bethe-Bloch model, as per [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-10554-0 "this Nature article").

In the absence of significant density corrections and in a moderate energy range, the algorithm provides an accurate, swiftly-converging approximation of the most probable energy loss from the Bethe-Bloch formula without numerical integration.
